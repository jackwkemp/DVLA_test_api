# DVLA Test API

This repository contains test code to pull information from the DVLA database using API requests. It includes Python files that can be used to retrieve data once you have access to the DVLA test API key. There are also HTML, CSS, and PHP files that demonstrate Post Requests for testing purposes.

## How to Use
1. Obtain a test API key from the DVLA.
2. Set up your Python environment and install any necessary libraries.
3. Run the Python scripts to pull data from the DVLA API.
4. Use the HTML/CSS/PHP files for experimenting with Post Requests.
